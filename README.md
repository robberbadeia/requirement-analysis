# **Requirement Analysis in Software Development.**

- ## **What is Requirement Analysis?**

  Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis in Software Development** repository, This repository dedicated to crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.

  **Requirement Analysis in Software Development** is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirments of the software product to be developed.

  This process ensures that all stakeholdes have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

- ## **Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**

  - **Ensure Clear Understanding of Project Goals:**

    It helps in understanding what the stackholders expect from the software, This clarity ensures that the development team aligns their work with the intended purpose of the software, reducing misunderstanding and miscommunicatin.

  - **Scope Defination of Project:**

    Clearly defines the scope of the project, It defines what is included and excluded from the project to ensure clear expectations among stackholders and to guide the project tream effectively.

  - **Basic for Design and Development:**

    - **Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.**
    - **Design** docuses on planing and structuring the solution to meet needs and project goal, It involves creating a blueprint for development.
    - **Development** involves transforming the design into a functional product using programming languages and tools

  - **Cost and Time Estimation:**
    Facilitaties accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time, Acurate estimations ensure that projects are delevered on time, with budget, and meet stakeholder expectations.

  - **Quality Assurance(QA):**
    Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirments, leading to higher customer satisfaction, QA is focused on improving the development and testing to prevent defects before they occur, rather than identifying them after they happen.
